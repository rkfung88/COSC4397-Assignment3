# COSC4397-Assignment3

In this Unity Project combined with Microsoft Mixed Reality Toolkit, you will be presented with a 3D model of a DeLorean. Attached to the DeLorean model are 3 MRTK features. The first one is the tooltip. This feature allows for labels to be created when "designing a car" in AR. The second feature incorperated into this program is the Bounded Box. With the bounded box, the user will be able to scale, rotate, and flip the 3D DeLorean model. Lastly, I decided to also add the App Bar feature provided by MRTK. This feature displays a bar underneath the 3D object and bounding box allowing the user to adjust or remove the object contained inside the bounding box. The idea of this design was to simulate how car compaines could possibly involved AR technology while designing their next line of vehicles.
